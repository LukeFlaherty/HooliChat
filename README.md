Expiramented with the Firebase Database service in cohesion with React to create a instant messaging platform that anyone can log onto and see messages from before they logged on and the messages update live as they are on the app.

Used React so that the page does not refresh after every message.

You are able to log in as any user and the Firebase DB Collection is set up as to remember who you are when you sign in and keep your messages on your side of the screen.

Used Material UI to style the page.
